Files:
DataPrep2.qmd takes in manually collected data and joins it with the data from cfbfastr and does some processing.

DataViz.qmd makes the visualizations in the report and some additional ones that were not used.

Modelling.qmd runs the lasso and ridge models for these data and produces the output for the report.

Errata:
Note we missed Mack Brown as coach of UNC (2nd time around) in our data and in the report.
